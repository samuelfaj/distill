# distill

Agent command outputs are one of the biggest sources of token waste.

Logs, test results, stack traces… thousands of tokens sent to an LLM just to answer a simple question.

**🔥 `distill` compresses command outputs into only what the LLM actually needs.**

Save **up to 99% of tokens** without losing the signal.

## How to use

Install:

```bash
npm i -g @samuelfaj/distill
```

Run onboarding:

```bash
distill
```

After onboarding you can use `/distill` skill in Claude / Codex or pipe command output into `distill`:

```bash
bun test 2>&1 | distill "Did tests pass? Return PASS or FAIL, followed by failing test names if any."
git diff | distill "What changed? Return only files changed and one-line summary for each."
terraform plan 2>&1 | distill "Is this safe? Return SAFE, REVIEW, or UNSAFE, followed by risky changes."
```

**Recommended LLM: qwen3.5-4b**

## Example

```sh
rg -n "terminal|PERMISSION|permission|Permissions|Plan|full access|default" desktop --glob '!**/node_modules/**' | distill "find where terminal and permission UI are implemented in chat screen"
```
