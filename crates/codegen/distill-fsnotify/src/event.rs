// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Public event types — the wire contract for `distill-fsnotify`.
//!
//! Pure data: no I/O, no tokio, no intra-crate deps. Safe to lift into a
//! sibling `-types` crate for WASM/no-tokio consumers.
//!
//! All variants are `#[non_exhaustive]`; add additively. The workspace
//! translator (in `distill-workspace`) maps these to
//! `WorkspaceEvent`s and enriches `GitOperationCompleted { head_changed:
//! true }` with `commit + branch + vcs` via a git shell-out — that I/O
//! belongs at the workspace layer, not on the OS-watcher hot path.
