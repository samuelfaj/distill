//! Checkpoint types for incremental markdown rendering.
//!
//! This module defines types for identifying stable boundaries in markdown text where rendered output can be "frozen" and cached.
//! Content before a checkpoint will not change regardless of what text is appended after it.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Checkpoints are only created at **top-level** (depth=0) block boundaries.
//! Blocks nested inside lists, blockquotes, or tables cannot be checkpoints because the outer container might continue.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```text
//! # Heading          <- Checkpoint after this (heading at depth=0)
//!
//! Paragraph text.    <- Checkpoint after blank line (paragraph at depth=0)
//!
//! - List item        <- NO checkpoint (inside list)
//!   ```code```       <- NO checkpoint (code block inside list)
//! - Another item
//!                    <- Checkpoint here (list closed at depth=0)
//! ```
