// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Spawn a child process, optionally feed it stdin, wait up to a wall-clock budget, and reap the whole process group on a breach.
//!
//! Used by both the optional [`crate::MmdcEngine`] (which shells out to `mmdc` and headless Chromium) and the pager's out-of-process render child.
//! That child is a short-lived re-exec of the pager that renders one diagram in isolation.
//! The timeout is a *real* process kill, not a soft signal.
//! A panic under `panic = "abort"` or a runaway render in the child is contained because the parent kills and reaps it.
//!
//! The caller builds the [`Command`] (stdio, env, and the TTY/console detach via `distill_tty_utils::detach_std_command`).
//! This module owns spawn, feed stdin, wait, and reap, so neither call site re-implements process-group teardown.
