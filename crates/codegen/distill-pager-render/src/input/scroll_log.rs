// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! `GROK_SCROLL_LOG` enables a JSONL log of scroll-stream transitions for offline analysis of real gestures.
//!
//! The pager's scroll-debug HUD (`views::scroll_debug_hud`) samples state per frame; this recorder logs every state-machine transition.
//! It writes one line per stream start, per flush that delivers lines, and per finalize (see [`super::mouse`]).
//! Flush attempts that deliver nothing are not logged; their spacing shows up in `ms_since_prev_flush`.
//! Records are flat JSON objects, one per line, and the writer flushes on finalize records so `tail -f` and `jq` work mid-session.
//!
//! Enablement: `GROK_SCROLL_LOG=1` (or set-but-empty) logs to
//! `~/.grok/logs/scroll-log-<timestamp>.jsonl`; any other non-`0` value is
//! used as the target path.
//! Unset (or `0`, matching `GROK_SCROLL_DEBUG`) disables: [`super::mouse::MouseScrollState`] holds `None` and each emission point costs one branch.
//!
//! Invariant (same contract as the HUD): pure observation; the recorder never feeds back into scroll behavior.
//! IO failures drop the record and disable the recorder with a single `tracing::warn!` (never stderr; that is the TUI's terminal), and never panic.
