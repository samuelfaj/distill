// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Off-draw-thread Mermaid render worker, per-session disk cache, and the [`AgentView`] lazy render-on-click glue (`[Open]` and `[Copy path]`).
//!
//! Mirrors the existing inline-video worker model (`std::thread::spawn` and `std::sync::mpsc`, polled each tick via `try_recv`) rather than tokio.
//! A single worker thread renders a requested diagram in a short-lived child process (see below).
//! It writes the PNG to the session's `mermaid/` dir and reports back only the on-disk path.
//! Diagrams are never displayed inline; the path is what the affordance row's `[Open]`/`[Copy path]` actions target.
//!
//! Rendering is **lazy**: nothing renders until the user clicks `[Open]` or `[Copy path]`.
//! The click renders the diagram at the *live* theme/width and then runs the requested action.
//! The render therefore always matches the current theme, including auto day/night.
//! A lock-free [`PendingMermaidAction`] list records what the user asked for so the tick can complete it when the matching render result arrives.
//! This mirrors how inline video loads via `mpsc` and poll.
//!
//! # Crash isolation under `panic = "abort"`: out of process
//!
//! The shipped CLI profiles build with `panic = "abort"`, so the `catch_unwind` inside [`distill_mermaid::render_checked`] is a no-op there.
//! A panic in the layout engine over untrusted model output would abort the whole pager.
//! A synchronous in-process render also could not be killed on timeout.
//! The render therefore runs **out of process**, in a short-lived child:
//!
//! 1. The pager re-execs itself as `distill-pager __mermaid-render` (see [`maybe_run_render_subprocess`]).
//!    The subcommand is intercepted at the very top of `main`, before any TUI/agent/runtime init.
//!    The child reads the source from stdin and the theme/width/height from argv.
//!    It renders the source to SVG then PNG, writes the PNG atomically to the out-path, and exits 0; any error exits non-zero.
//! 2. The worker spawns that child with a wall-clock budget ([`RENDER_TIMEOUT`]) via [`distill_mermaid::run_with_timeout`].
//!    On timeout it **kills and reaps** the child (a real process kill, not a soft signal).
//!    A child panic (abort), non-zero exit, or timeout is contained to the child and becomes `Failed`, the existing code-block fallback.
//!    The pager survives.
//! 3. The child applies the same caps as in-process would.
//!    Those are the source-size limit ([`distill_mermaid::RenderLimits`]) and the raster megapixel/height caps (see `distill-mermaid`).
//!    The parent also rejects obviously-oversized source before spawning, to avoid launching a doomed child.
//!
//! Because untrusted source now renders fully isolated, the feature is on by default (no cargo gate).
//! The `appearance.render_mermaid` setting still gates it at runtime.
