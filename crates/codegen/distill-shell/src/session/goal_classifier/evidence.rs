// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Evidence-packet construction for the goal-verification stage.
//!
//! The packet is a strictly-formatted block that each adversarial skeptic subagent receives as its user prompt:
//!
//! ```text
//! OBJECTIVE:
//! <objective>
//!
//! CHANGES_FILE: <patch path or `(unavailable)`>
//!
//! CHANGED_FILES:
//! - <path>
//! ...
//!
//! PLAN_FILE: <plan path or `(unavailable)`>
//!
//! PLAN_CHANGES: <unified diff of plan edits, or `(none)`>
//!
//! FINAL_RESPONSE:
//! <last assistant text, sanitized>
//! ```
//!
//! `PLAN_CHANGES` is the diff from the plan baseline to the current plan (the agent may edit `plan.md` mid-run).
//! It renders `(none)` when there is no baseline, no edits, or the diff could not be captured.
//!
//! `CHANGES_FILE` is a unified-diff *changelog*: a scope pointer, and the anchor for checking the model's claims against the diff.
//! It may be truncated.
//! `CHANGED_FILES` is the *complete* list of touched paths the skeptic reads in their current state.
//! Verification rests on the live files and on running the code, not on the diff alone.
//! The section names are consumed verbatim by `templates/goal_verifier_prompt.md`.
//! Changing a format constant here means updating the template and bumping any prompt-eval baselines.
