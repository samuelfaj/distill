//! Heuristic stop-detector for premature "give up" turn endings.
//!
//! The model is judged to be bailing out when the LAST non-empty paragraph of its turn-final text starts with one of the patterns below.
//! The patterns are phrasings commonly used as a bail / hand-off / verdict signal.
//! On a hit, `maybe_queue_goal_continuation` (reached on the success / continuation path) renders the bail-specific nudge instead of the generic one.
//! The harness emits `Event::GoalPrematureStopDetected { pattern }` tagged with the matched pattern label.
//! Dashboards use the pattern label to audit precision / recall of the regex panel.
//!
//! Two patterns are expressed in two stages rather than as a single regex:
//!
//! 1. [`CHECK_BACK_LATER`]: a single-regex form would need a negative lookahead `(?!your?\b)` that the `regex` crate does not support.
//!    The same check runs in two stages instead: a broad first-stage regex, then a `your`/`you` post-filter in `check_back_later_matches`.
//! 2. `STOPPING_HERE`: the base trailer set `(?:\.|$| \u2014| -| until| pending| since| because)` is widened to include `,`, `;`, and ` for `.
//!    Natural sign-offs like "Stopping here for now.", "Stopping here, will come back later.", and "Paused here; review needed." still fire.
//!    The widening is bounded by a non-letter boundary in the tests so in-word matches like "Stopping hereafter" stay rejected.
//!
//! Intentionally omitted from this panel: a broad catch-all "continuation deferral" pattern (`\b(?:once|when|after|until|as soon as)\b…`).
//! Stand-alone it fires on routine work narration ("Once the test settles I'll iterate"), and that false-positive rate dwarfs the bail signal.
//! The more specific patterns below already cover the bail phrasings.
