// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Bounded stdio MCP auto-restart.
//!
//! Auto-restart triggers on [`McpClientEventKind::TransportClosed`] and [`McpClientEventKind::HandshakeFailed`] keys for **stdio** MCP servers.
//! When [`crate::session::mcp_dispatcher::run_dispatcher`] processes a window containing such a key, it hands the key to [`maybe_schedule_restart`].
//! That function applies the guard rails listed below; if all pass, it spawns a one-shot [`auto_restart_stdio`] task.
//! The task sleeps and respawns up to three times before parking the server as `unavailable`.
//!
//! ## Backoff
//!
//! Three attempts at exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! attempt 1 → +1s  (t=1s)
//! attempt 2 → +4s  (t=5s)
//! attempt 3 → +16s (t=21s)
//! ```
//!
//! Encoded as [`BACKOFF`]. The full window before exhaustion is 21 s.
//!
//! ## Guard rails (skip conditions)
//!
//! Both check sites read the same ground truth, BUT the **check order differs by design**; see the comparison table below.
//!
//! 1. **Non-restart event kind**: `maybe_schedule_restart` short-circuits for anything other than `TransportClosed` / `HandshakeFailed`.
//!    The auto-restart loop does not see other kinds (it's never invoked for them), so this gate appears only at schedule time.
//! 2. **HTTP / HttpAuth**: auto-restart is **stdio-only**.
//!    HTTP/OAuth transports go through `reset_transport` on the next tool call, which is the existing and correct recovery path.
//!    [`RestartActions::is_stdio_server_configured`] returns `false` for any non-stdio configured entry.
//!    That single check doubles as the HTTP filter, so no separate `is_http` check is needed.
//! 3. **`kill_on_drop` from config diff**:
//!    In its `acp::McpServer::Stdio` arm, [`distill_mcp::servers::start_mcp_server`] sets `kill_on_drop(true)` on the child it spawns.
//!    When `McpState::update_configs_diff` drops the `Arc<McpClient>`, the child is SIGKILLed.
//!    The liveness watcher eventually emits `TransportClosed`.
//!    The dispatcher's [`crate::session::mcp_dispatcher::ShutdownState`], set on `ConfigRemoved` events, records that the teardown was intentional.
//!    We consult it via [`RestartActions::is_in_shutting_down`] at both check sites.
//! 4. **Disabled / not currently configured**: `update_configs_diff` or `ToggleMcpServer enabled=false` removes the stdio entry.
//!    We consult [`RestartActions::is_stdio_server_configured`], which already folds in the disabled-list check.
//!    On `false` mid-loop we emit one final [`crate::session::mcp_dispatcher::McpServerStatusReason::Disabled`] push and stop.
//! 5. **Already-Empty**: see the [`distill_mcp::servers::ClientStateKind::Empty`] doc: a previous handshake exhausted attempts.
//!    Recovery from `Empty` is via the explicit `Refresh` button, not auto-restart.
//!    Enforced upstream: the liveness watcher emits `TransportClosed` only from `Ready` / `Initializing`, never from `Empty`.
//!
//! ### Check-order difference
//!
//! | Site                       | First check                        | Then                              |
//! |----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
//! | [`maybe_schedule_restart`] | `is_in_shutting_down` (cheap, sync)| `is_stdio_server_configured` (async, may hit disk) |
//! | [`auto_restart_stdio`] loop| `is_stdio_server_configured`       | `is_in_shutting_down`             |
//!
//! At schedule time we shed the cheap sync check first so we never pay the async and disk hit for an event we'll skip anyway.
//! Inside the loop the priority inverts: the "user removed it" path needs a wire push (`Reason::Disabled`) before we exit, so we check it first.
//! The `shutting_down` exit needs no push; the upstream `ConfigRemoved` flush already emitted one.
//!
//! ## Telemetry
//!
//! Emitted via `tracing::info!` with the metric name in the `target:` field (`metrics.mcp.auto_restart.<counter>`), one target per metric.
//!
//! | Metric                              | Labels                                                      |
//! |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `mcp.auto_restart.attempted`        | `server`, `attempt`                                         |
//! | `mcp.auto_restart.succeeded`        | `server`, `attempt ∈ {1,2,3}`                               |
//! | `mcp.auto_restart.exhausted`        | `server`                                                    |
//! | `mcp.auto_restart.skipped`          | `server`, `reason ∈ {shutting_down, not_configured, disabled}` |
//!
//! `attempted` is counted once per actual `respawn_stdio` call (after the in-loop guards pass and the backoff sleep elapses), not at task entry.
//! That way it stays honest if the configured set flips mid-sleep.
