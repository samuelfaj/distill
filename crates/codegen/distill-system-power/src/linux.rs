//! Linux system sleep/wake via systemd-logind's `PrepareForSleep` D-Bus
//! signal, with a `delay` inhibitor lock so we get a short window to react
//! before the system actually sleeps.
//!
//! Uses the `zbus` blocking API on a dedicated thread so we don't require the
//! caller to run any particular async runtime. If the system bus or logind is
//! unavailable (non-systemd distro, container, permission error), `start`
//! returns `None` and the caller degrades gracefully.
