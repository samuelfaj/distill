//! The per-server diagnostics store.
//!
//! Diagnostics reach us two ways — pushed by the server via
//! `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`, or pulled by us via
//! `textDocument/diagnostic` — and both land here, so the rest of the code has
//! one place to read from.
//!
//! Every answer says which document version it describes. That is what makes
//! "has the server given a verdict on the edit I just sent?" a comparison
//! rather than a guess. Without it, the presence of an entry means only "the
//! server said something about this file at some point", which cannot tell a
//! file that is genuinely clean now from one that was clean before the edit
//! that broke it.
//!
//! The version comes from the protocol wherever the protocol provides one: a
//! pull knows which revision it asked about, and a pushed report may carry the
//! version it was computed for. Only a push that omits it falls back to
//! arrival order — it is credited with the newest version we had sent when it
//! arrived.
