//! When the server tells us its answers have changed.
//!
//! A pull-model server answers whatever it knows at the moment it is asked,
//! which after an edit — or during the first load of a large solution — may be
//! nothing yet. The protocol's answer to that is not for the client to guess
//! how long analysis takes, but for the server to say when it has finished:
//! `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` asks the client to re-pull everything, and
//! Roslyn sends it on re-analysis, project load and configuration changes.
//! Roslyn also has its own `workspace/projectInitializationComplete`, which is
//! what other clients use as the "the solution is really open now" signal.
//!
//! Both mean the same thing to us: ask again about everything we have open.
