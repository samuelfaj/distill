// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! OpenCode-specific tool implementations.
//!
//! This module contains tools ported from the [sst/opencode] project
//! (`packages/opencode/src/tool/`), which is licensed under the MIT
//! License. Copyright (c) 2025 opencode. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` at

//! Most tools follow the opencode parameter
//! naming conventions (e.g., `read`/`edit` use `filePath`, `oldString`,
//! `newString`); `write` is the exception — its input was normalized to
//! snake_case (`file_path`) for distill consistency.
