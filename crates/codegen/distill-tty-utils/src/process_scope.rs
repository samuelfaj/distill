//! Kill-handle for a session's child-process trees (`Send + Sync`).

//! If a session's worker thread wedges, its `Drop`s never run and child

//! can `kill_all()` one session's children without restarting the host.
//!
//! # Weak-keyed registry (PID-reuse safety)
//!
//! Each child enrolls as a [`ProcessGroup`]. The scope holds only `Weak`
//! references; the spawn-site owner holds the strong `Arc`. On `kill_all`,
//! only groups whose owner is still alive (i.e. un-reaped children) upgrade
//! successfully — reaped children upgrade to `None` and are skipped. This
//! prevents `killpg` from hitting a reused PID.
//!
//! # Residual
//!
//! `kill_all` SIGKILLs but doesn't `wait` (would race the live owner).
//! A wedged owner's killed leader stays as a zombie until the host exits —
//! bounded by wedge events, not sessions.
