//! Worker-thread and blocking-pool policy for tokio runtimes.
//!
//! Tokio defaults to one worker per core and 512 blocking threads *per
//! runtime*. On many-core shared hosts that pins too many thread slots
//! against per-user ceilings (`pids.max` / `RLIMIT_NPROC`). Grok runtimes
//! are I/O-bound, so throughput does not scale past a small worker count.
//!
//! Blocking pool: `spawn_blocking` panics on `pthread_create` EAGAIN only
//! when the pool is empty. Once one thread exists, further EAGAIN queues.
//! Cap the pool so it cannot stampede to 512. Keep idle threads forever so
//! the pool never returns to 0. Pre-warm process-lifetime runtimes so the
//! first mid-turn `spawn_blocking` does not take the empty-pool panic arm.
//!
//! This is the single home for the policy. Every production multi-thread
//! runtime (the `grok` binary, `workspace_server`) derives its worker count
//! from here.
