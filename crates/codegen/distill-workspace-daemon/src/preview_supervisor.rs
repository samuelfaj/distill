// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! One-child supervisor for the in-sandbox preview-proxy.
//!
//! After the workspace-server self-daemonizes (see [`crate::daemonize`]) it spawns the unchanged `/usr/local/bin/xai-grok-preview-proxy` binary.
//! It supervises exactly that one child: fork/exec, `wait`, then restart on exit with a capped backoff that resets after a healthy run.
//!
//! Two properties depend on *where* this runs:
//! - The child is spawned only from [`supervise_preview`], which the bin invokes **after** daemonize.
//!   The child therefore inherits the daemon's new session/pgid and escapes the launcher's process-group reap.
//!   One daemonize protects both processes.
//! - `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG(SIGKILL)` binds the child's lifetime to the workspace-server so a WS crash cannot orphan the proxy holding the ports.
//!   PDEATHSIG keys off the *spawning thread*.
//!   The race between fork and exec (the WS dies before the child's `prctl` runs) is closed by re-checking `getppid()` in `pre_exec`.
//!   The supervise task is spawned on tokio's long-lived `multi_thread` workers so a worker thread's death cannot kill the child spuriously.
