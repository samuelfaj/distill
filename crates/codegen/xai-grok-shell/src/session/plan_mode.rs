//! Plan mode state machine and prompt text generation.
//!
//! This module contains the [`PlanModeTracker`] struct that manages the full plan mode lifecycle for a session.
//! It is designed to be testable in isolation: pure state machine logic, with no references to `SessionActor`, conversation history, or async I/O.
//!
//! The `SessionActor` owns one `PlanModeTracker` (behind a `Mutex`).
//! It calls the tracker's methods at the appropriate points (`handle_session_mode`, `handle_prompt`, `handle_completion`, `run_compact`).
