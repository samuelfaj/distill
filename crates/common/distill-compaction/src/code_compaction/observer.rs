// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Observability seam for the full-replace (distill) pass.
//!
//! The shared orchestrator reports per-attempt and terminal outcomes through
//! this trait so each harness can emit its own telemetry (distill:
//! `CompactionAttempt` rows, `CompactionRetryDegraded` events, span records,
//! request-artifact persistence) without the shared crate depending on a
//! telemetry backend. Mirrors
//! [`IntraCompactionObserver`](crate::intra_compaction::IntraCompactionObserver)
//! / [`InterCompactionObserver`](crate::inter_compaction::InterCompactionObserver).
//!
//! Emission points are part of the behavior contract: the distill observer
//! preserves the pre-migration `CompactionAttempt`/`CompactionRetryDegraded`
//! semantics byte-for-byte.
