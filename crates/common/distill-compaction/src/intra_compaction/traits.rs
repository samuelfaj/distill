///   (coarse) compaction.

/// The single mutator [`Self::replace_with_compaction`] takes a
/// [`CompactionTarget`] and dispatches internally to the steps- or
/// history-specific path. It is the final step of a compaction cycle:
/// the LLM-produced summary is committed into parser state. The
/// orchestrator [`super::apply_intra_compaction`] and its peers
/// [`super::apply_steps_compaction`] / [`super::apply_history_compaction`]
/// are the layers above that produce the summary and call this method.
///
/// Implementations that don't support a particular target return
/// [`IntraCompactionError::Unsupported`] from the matching match arm.
