// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! `InnerDispatchForResolver` — an object-safe `ToolDispatch` that routes
//! through a `Weak<CompoundResolver>` bound to a single session.
//!
//! Tools that need to call other tools (the inner-dispatch pattern) ask
//! the runtime for an `Arc<dyn ToolDispatch>`. This adapter answers that
//! question with a resolver-backed implementation. Holding the resolver
//! by [`Weak`] lets the router own the resolver while inner-dispatch
//! handles created from the same resolver release naturally when the
//! router is torn down.

/// [`ToolError::Custom`] keyed `computer_hub_dropped`.

/// Bound to a single [`SessionId`] at construction (rather than reading a
/// session from [`ToolCallContext`]) so the inner-dispatch path mirrors
/// the per-session lifetime of the outer router.
