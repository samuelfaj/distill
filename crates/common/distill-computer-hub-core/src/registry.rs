// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Object-safe `ToolRegistry` trait shared by every storage plane.
//!
//! Two registry implementations are expected: one in-memory plane for
//! statically-registered local tools, and one connection-keyed plane fed by
//! incoming remote registrations. Both expose the same trait so the
//! router can compose them through [`crate::CompoundResolver`] without
//! caring which is which.
//!
//! Mutations are connection-scoped: each registered tool belongs to the
//! [`ConnectionId`] that introduced it. Per-tool session bindings live
//! alongside the tool's record and are mutated independently via
//! [`ToolRegistry::bind_tool_session`] / [`ToolRegistry::unbind_tool_session`].
//! Reads (`find_tool`, `list_tools`, `search`) remain session-scoped — the
//! router resolves a tool by `(session_id, tool_id)`, never by
//! connection id.
//!
//! The concrete in-memory implementation is intentionally **out of scope**
//! for this crate — it requires a concurrency story (sharded maps, an
//! actor, etc.) that belongs alongside the registry's collision matrix and
//! generation handling.

///   top-level `ServerError::ToolBindingConflict` (-32600) instead of
///   mirroring it to the wire ack, so the contended caller gets a
///   dedicated error code rather than overloading `UnknownTool`.
/// - The wire enum's `SessionNotBound` is router-injected by the
///   per-frame envelope pre-check (the connection's bound-session set
///   lives in router state, not the registry) and is never produced by
///   any registry call — so it has no counterpart here.
