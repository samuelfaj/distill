// Modified for Distill by Samuel Fajreldines, 2026.
//! Object-safe `Transport` trait plus the `Principal` value carried across
//! authorize/call boundaries.
//!
//! [`TransportKind`] is re-exported from [`distill_tool_protocol`] so the wire
//! and dispatch layers share one canonical enum and there is no duplicate
//! `Local` / `Remote` definition to keep in sync.
