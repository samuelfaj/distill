//! Auth credentials and pool-dedup principal keys.
//!
//! [`AuthCredential`] models the credential the client attaches at
//! handshake time. Two variants are supported:
//!
//! - [`AuthCredential::Bearer`] for the simple "Authorization: Bearer
//!   …" path (e.g. JWT-against-OAuth2 deployments).
//! - [`AuthCredential::Headers`] for callers that already hold a
//!   pre-built header bundle (e.g. signed identity headers generated
//!   by an upstream proxy or test harness).
//!
//! [`PrincipalKey`] is the stable hashable projection of an
//! `AuthCredential`; the pool keys connections by
//! `(url, principal_key)` so two [`crate::ToolServer`] builds with the
//! same credential reuse one socket while distinct credentials open
//! distinct sockets. The server derives `user_id` from the credential at
//! upgrade time and returns it in the hello ack — the SDK never needs
//! to carry `user_id` alongside the credential.
//!
//! ## Pool dedup and credential refresh
//!
//! Both variants include the secret material in the `PrincipalKey`
//! fingerprint. This is deliberate: distinct secrets imply distinct
//! credentials, so two callers with different tokens open distinct
//! sockets. The trade-off is that a caller that rotates its bearer JWT
//! every N minutes will open a new socket on each rotation.
//! Long-running tool servers should reuse the SAME [`AuthCredential`]
//! instance across builds and refresh the credential out-of-band rather
//! than hand a fresh JWT to every build.
