//! Canonical partial-result streaming contract shared by every streaming tool.
//!
//! A tool declares a [`StreamingSpec`] in its [`ToolCapabilities`] and emits
//! deltas from `execute` via [`stream_chunk`], which materializes the spec into
//! a [`PartialResultPayload`] carried by [`ToolProgress::Custom`]. Downstream
//! layers dispatch on the envelope's `subkind` rather than on the tool's
//! identity.
